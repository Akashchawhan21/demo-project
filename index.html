            The environment refers to the surrounding conditions in which living organisms, including 
            humans, plants, and animals, exist. It includes both the natural elements like air, water, soil, and forests, 
            as well as man-made components such as cities, roads, and industries. The environment provides 
            resources necessary for survival and is essential for maintaining ecological balance.
